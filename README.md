Feature extraction and deep learning methods are applied to classify urban sounds.
- Short presentation of the project [here](https://github.com/angela18199/Sound_classification_urbansound8k/blob/master/Project_Presentation.mp4).
- Project report [here](https://github.com/angela18199/Sound_classification_urbansound8k/blob/master/Project_Report.pdf).
- Notebook [here](https://github.com/angela18199/Sound_classification_urbansound8k/blob/master/Sound_classifcation.ipynb).
* If you want to run the notebook, you need to download the .wav data from data source yourself. It is 7GB big. Therefore, the data is not included in the repository.
